# intro-to-psychopy

Quick set of examples to guide through PsychoPy. Incrementally builds on from set 1's components to set 4's. The example sets will show how to setup the components and display multiple texts from a csv file.

To efficiently understand PsychoPy, below lists some main components of PsychoPy code:

1. Initial Setup Part:
  - experiment variables/parameter
  - creating window
  - setting path
  - text instructions as strings
  - text/visual stim components
  - set clocks to keep track of timing
  - read in stim file

2. Actual Experiment Code:
  - actual experiment code to loop over each stimuli file

3. Logging and Saving Out Data
  - save out log file
  - save out data
